## Installation

### Recommended

It is highly recommended that you use the [aperitiiif-batch-template](https://github.com/nyu-dss/aperitiiif-batch-template) repo to create your new batch project. This method will include all the necessary Ruby dependencies and project structure.

### Manual

Alternatively, you can add the gem to your project's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'aperitiiif', github: 'nyu-dss/aperitiiif-cli'
```

Then install by running the command:

``` sh
bundle install
```

## Usage

After your batch project is set up and you have installed the dependencies using Bundler, you will have access to the `aperitiiif` commands.

1. Check available commands
  ```sh
  bundle exec aperitiiif --help
  ```
2. Check available batch commands
  ```sh
  bundle exec aperitiiif batch --help
  ```
  You will see something like:
  ```sh
  âžœ bundle exec aperitiiif batch --help
    Commands:
    aperitiiif batch build           # build batch resources
    aperitiiif batch help [COMMAND]  # Describe subcommands or one specific subc...
    aperitiiif batch lint            # lint the batch
    aperitiiif batch reset           # reset the batch
  ```

## Development

Contributions should:
- Avoid code smells
- Follow style guide

To ensure the above, this repo includes configuration for [reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek) and [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) as well as [rspec](https://rspec.info/) tests. You can run them respectively with the following commands:

```sh
bundle exec reek
```
```sh
bundle exec rubocop -A
```
```sh
bundle exec rspec
```
